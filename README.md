# Tindog-Bootstrap-Tutorial
This repository contains the Tindog website project, which I built as part of a Bootstrap tutorial on Udemy. Tindog is a playful take on a dating app for dogs. I used Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework, to design and style this responsive website. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities, enhancing my web development skills.
